    <h1>Работа с GIT</h1>
    <h2>Работа с GitHub</h2>
    <p>The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model. Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.</p>
    
    <p>This means that you can do things like:
    Frictionless Context Switching. Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.</p>
